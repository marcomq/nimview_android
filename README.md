# nimview_android
A Nim/Webview based helper to create Android applications with Nim/C/C++ and HTML/CSS

Android Studio implementation of [Nimview](https://github.com/marcomq/nimview)

This project uses Android Webview as UI layer. The back-end is supposed to be written in Nim, C/C++
or - if it doesn't need to be ported to other platforms - Kotlin or Java.
As the compilation process is slow, it would be recommended to write a web application 
with nimview or npm first and then check the changes on Android later.

So the recommended workflow would be:
```
(installation)
git clone https://github.com/marcomq/nimview_android.git
cd app/src/main/nim
nimble install -d -y
cd ../..
cd nimview/examples/svelte
npm install 
cd ../../../../..

(development)
(open two terminals/shells, t1 and t2)
t1: nim cpp -r -d:useServer app/src/main/nim/custom_nimview.nim
t2: npm run dev --prefix app/src/nimview/examples/svelte
open browser at http://localhost:5000
(optional) modify nim / html / js code in VSCode
restart nim server to apply changes on nim code
press F5 if browser doesn't refresh automatically after js changes

(release and testing)
compile project with android studio, test, perform changes if required

```

The nimview directory is a git subtree of https://github.com/marcomq/nimview. The steps performed were:
```
 git subtree add --prefix app/src/nimview https://github.com/marcomq/nimview.git main --squash
 git subtree pull --prefix app/src/nimview --squash  https://github.com/marcomq/nimview.git main
```
To updated to the latest Nimview version, perform the `git subtree pull ...` command above.
